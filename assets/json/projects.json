      To aid in this groups mission I helped design and develop the electronics \

      used to make the cut outs of the plywood boards that the electrical \
      components were attached to. Further, I applied my soldering and \
      SolidWorks skills to aid in the completion of these bays. I \
      collaborated in a group setting to overcome engineering challenges such \
      as managing the constraints of space, ensuring the boards were secure, and \
       making the boards accessible for rocket recovery.",
