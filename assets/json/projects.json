      <br> \
      <br> \
      To aid in this groups mission I helped design and develop the electronics \
      bay for the rockets. I gain experience using a laser cutter which was \
      used to make the cut outs of the plywood boards that the electrical \
      components were attached to. Further, I applied my soldering and \
      SolidWorks skills to aid in the completion of these bays. I \
      collaborated in a group setting to overcome engineering challenges such \
      as managing the constraints of space, ensuring the boards were secure, and \
       making the boards accessible for rocket recovery.",

        50-person team. Particularly, my part was to research, \
        report and suggest improvements on the transportation needs \
        of fellow high schoolers. I used Photoshop to create simulated \
        outcomes of our proposals. Overall, I contributed by writing, \
        preparing and presenting our group's findings to the Portsmouth \
        City Council. The report was later published in the local news.",
